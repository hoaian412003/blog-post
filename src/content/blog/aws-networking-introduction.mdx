#### Introduction
_**AWS networking** is fundamental for connecting resources, controlling traffic flow, and integrating with on-premises or hybrid environments._

Core components inside the AWS networking
- **Amazon VPC**:
    VPC allows you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can define your own IP address ranges, create subnets, route tables, and configure gateways. This lets you control how your resources are accessed and how they communicate with each other and the internet.
    
    _The VPC is like a school building. Just as a school has its own boundaries, classrooms, and rules for how students and teachers move around and interact, a VPC provides a secure, organized environment for your AWS resources to operate and communicate._

- **Subnets**:
    Subnets are segments of a VPC's IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources. They allow you to separate resources based on security and operational needs, such as public and private subnets.
    
    _Subnets are like different classrooms within the school. Each classroom can have its own purpose and set of students, just as subnets can separate resources for different functions or security levels._
- **Route Tables**:
    Route tables contain a set of rules, called routes, that determine where network traffic from your subnets or gateway is directed. They control the flow of traffic within your VPC and to the internet.
    
    _Route tables are like the school's hallway signs and schedules, guiding students on how to get from one classroom to another or to the exit._
- **Gateway** _(Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway)_:
    Gateways enable communication between your VPC and the internet or other AWS services. An Internet Gateway allows resources in your VPC to access the internet, while a NAT Gateway enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet without being directly exposed.
    
    _Gateways are like the main entrance and special doors of the school. The main entrance (Internet Gateway) lets people in and out, while a staff-only door (NAT Gateway) allows teachers to leave without letting students follow._
- **Network Access Control List** _(Security Groups & NACLs)_:
    Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for your instances to control inbound and outbound traffic. Network ACLs provide an additional layer of security at the subnet level, controlling traffic to and from subnets.
    
    _Security Groups and NACLs are like the school's security guards and classroom door locks. Security guards (Security Groups) check who can enter or leave each classroom, while door locks (NACLs) control access to entire hallways or sections._
- **AWS Direct Connect & VPN**:
    AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS, improving bandwidth and reducing latency. VPN (Virtual Private Network) allows secure connectivity between your on-premises network and AWS over the internet.
    
    _AWS Direct Connect & VPN are like a private school bus route (Direct Connect) and a secure public bus (VPN) that bring students from home to school safely and efficiently._
- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**:
    ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
    
    _ELB is like the school's front desk, directing visitors to the right classroom or office so no single room gets overcrowded._
- **Amazon Route 53**:
    Route 53 is a scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service designed to route end-user requests to internet applications hosted in AWS, providing domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking.
    
    _Route 53 is like the school's directory or receptionist, helping visitors find the correct classroom or staff member by name._
